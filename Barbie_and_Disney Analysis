In these SQL queries, I am extracting various information from the "BIT_DB" database, 
focusing on Barbie characters and related details such as names, 
characteristics, voice actors, and Disney+ movies, utilizing conditions and ordering to tailor the results.

SELECT*
FROM BIT_DB.Barbie_Table;

SELECT*
FROM BIT_DB.Barbie_Characters;

SELECT "Character Name"
FROM BIT_DB.Barbie_Characters;

/*Show me the Barbies the names of the Barbies that are Princesses and are Human*/
SELECT "Character Name"
FROM BIT_DB.Barbie_Characters
WHERE "Character Name" LIKE '%Princess%' AND Race='Human';

/*Show me the male names of the male characters with Brown or Dark hair in alphabetical order */
SELECT "Character Name"
FROM BIT_DB.Barbie_Characters
WHERE (Gender='Male') AND Hair='Brown' OR Hair LIKE "%Dark%"
ORDER BY "Character Name";

/*Show me the Characters that are  fairies and have blue eyes in Descending order */
SELECT DISTINCT "Character Name"
FROM BIT_DB.Barbie_Characters 
WHERE Race LIKE '%Fairy%' AND Eyes='Blue'
ORDER BY "Character Name";

/*Show me the titles of Movies that are from The United States in ascending order*/
SELECT title
FROM Disney_Plus
WHERE type='Movie' AND Country="United States"
ORDER BY title;

/*Show me the Character names for Barbie Characters that voiced by Lee Tockar in descending order*/
SELECT "Character Name"
FROM BIT_DB.Barbie_Characters
WHERE "Speaking Voice"= 'Lee Tockar'
ORDER BY "Character Name" DESC;
